            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I have preached to, <hi>Profeſſors,</hi> and heard others preach to them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered my own preaching and theirs, (what and how we have preached) and the ſucceſs of our preaching. I have hearkened, and heard, and ſeen, and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, who have preached aright, or made ſuch uſe as ought to be made of that which hath been preached, and <hi>who hath repented and reformed,</hi> Jer. 8. 6.

For the honour of the moſt high God, and the credit of his Goſpel, and your own good, and the good of your Poſterity, <hi>(Deut. 5. 29.)</hi> and of all <hi>Chriſts</hi> people, uſe the moſt effectual means <hi>ye can,</hi> to perſwade and induce every one himſelf, and all thoſe to whom I ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

That <hi>in afflicting us he hath done wiſely, and therefore afflicted us for fit ends,</hi> Marg. 18. 5. We muſt conſider, <hi>Why and for what ends he hath afflicted us?</hi> Marg. 18. Theſe five things
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:151856:6"/> we ought to conſider, that we may not deſpiſe his chaſtening, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 11, 12. nor harbour hard thoughts of him: and that we may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern what courſe to take for the bettering of our Eſtate. 6.

We muſt conſider <hi>the ſucceſs and iſſue of thoſe means, how far we have prevailed by uſing them, and how far not,</hi> Marg. 92. 8. If our Eſtate hath not thereupon been changed fully, according to <hi>our deſires and requeſts;</hi> then we are to conſider, <hi>Why God hath not heard them to the full? what hath hindred them, and made them ſo far forth uneffectual? especially, whether iniquities and ſins have hindred them? and, if ſins, whoſe ſins, and which of their ſins?</hi> Eſ. 59. 1, 2.

            <p>Now as to the firſt of theſe, I have known when our Trading was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> not (<hi>altogether</hi>) ſo dead, and ſo much hindered; when many of the poorer ſort had more work, and many of the richer ſort more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; when many were better able to maintain their Children, and to bind them Apprentices, and to furniſh them with moneys for Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and to make them Scholars, when many were more able to pay their Rents and other debts; when Houſes and Lands were ſet and ſold at higher Rates without wronging the Takers and Buyers; when the total of our publick Taxes and payments was not (<hi>altogether</hi>) ſo great as now (<hi>to ſome</hi>) it ſeems to be, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When ſo many of this Nation were not taken away by the Peſtilence, and by and in Sea-actions im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſhed, maimed, wounded, killed, and deprived of their Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, Fathers, Children, and Apprentices; and when ſo many Churches, and publick Houſes, and ſo many private Houſes have not been burnt, and ſo much (<hi>worldly</hi>) Riches deſtroyed in <hi>London</hi> in ſo few days as of late in 1666. have been. But all theſe and <hi>ſome other</hi> evils are common to us with others, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 12, 28.</p>
            <p>2. Some of us have been deprived (and do continue deſtituted) of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> our places of credit and profit, and conſequently of our <hi>Livelihood</hi> and maintenance, and are forbidden to teach or table Scholars, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though (<hi>peradventure</hi>) we might in that way be ſomewhat beneficial to the Church and Common-wealth.)</p>
            <p>3. Some of us are ſeparated from <hi>London,</hi> and all other Cities, and many Tows which are not Cities <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. No private Meetings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> under the pain of Baniſhment into <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Forreign Plantations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>6. The fellowſhip which we have had together in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, muſt be broken oft, and the ſpiritual benefits which we might have gotten by converſing together loſt, <hi>Beſide the loſſes of</hi> Luke the 8. 2, 3.</p>
            <p>7. This is a time of extraordinary Temptations <hi>to us and others.</hi> Many profeſſors, eſpecially Preachers, are tempted to ſin againſt their Conſciences, to get places of worldly profit, and to bear ſinfully with the ſins of Profeſſors, leſt they ſhould loſe the help of their Purſes, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are tempted to avenge themſelves, to oppreſs, to uſe cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty.</p>

I think, the <hi>laſt</hi> twenty years and upwards are part of the peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous times, whereof St. <hi>Paul</hi> prophecyeth, in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. in the firſt 7 Verſes, beginning with, <hi>This know alſo,</hi> as ſpeaking of that which is very fit to be known, and to be conſidered very ſeriouſly. <hi>This know alſo</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that in the laſt dayes perillous times ſhall come. For men ſhall be lovers of their own ſelves, covetous, boaſters, proud. Having a form of Godlineſs, but denying the power thereof, which words I do underſt and of many of thoſe who have gotten the name of Profeſſors, as well as of others,</hi> and that, becauſe ſo many do walk and behave themſelves, <hi>as if God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs were of no great power to better a mans converſation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>9. If <hi>none</hi> of the late <hi>Decrees,</hi> and the Outings and Reſtraints do (in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> 
               <hi>any</hi> meaſure, directly nor indirectly) tend unto the decay of that which <hi>the Book of Common-Prayer</hi> calls <hi>Gods true Religion and vertue;</hi> yet before the time of the <hi>Interruption</hi> there were, who, under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of reconciling two Religions, ſought <hi>to undermine and deſtroy the better of the twain:</hi> and in the time of the Interruption, Corrupters and new Lights, who did hatch Cockatrice Eggs, Ranters, (Familiſts) Quakers: and part of that evil work was done (I doubt not) in Policy of purpoſe to undermine and deſtroy Truths. In a word, there have been theſe laſt thirty years and more, and ſtill (I believe) are <hi>ſome,</hi> whoſe working (<hi>partly in the dark</hi>) hath been and is ſuch, that as the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>Pſal. 119. 126.

               <hi>without hard thoughts of God,</hi> or charging him fooliſhly (<hi>Job</hi> 1. 21.) let us ſtedfaſtly believe, and ſeriouſly conſider, That <hi>he, in giving way ſo far to the deſires, purpoſes, devices and enterpizes of men, hath not dealt unjuſtly with any of us, nor done any of us any wrong.</hi> For, 1. <hi>He is righteous in all his wayes and works,</hi> Pſal. 145. 17. <hi>and doth not afflict or grieve</hi> any of the children of men, <hi>cauſleſs,</hi> or <hi>meerly for his pleaſure.</hi> (ſo we are to underſtand the words of <hi>Jeremy,</hi> Lam. 3. 33.) 2.

Neither Juſtification, nor the new. Birth, doth bring with it an inward ſanctification which is perfect in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> degrees, <hi>Phil. 3. 12, 13.

            <p>4. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We muſt believe and conſider, That God, who doth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> all his works in wiſdom, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. 24. hath done wiſely in afflicting us, and therefore afflicted us for good and fit ends.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>The fifth thing</hi> to be conſidered is, why and <hi>for what cauſes and ends</hi> the Lord our God hath ſuffered all the evils before mentioned to come upon us? For he doth not ſo much as give way to the deſires of men, without ſome ſufficient cauſe, (<hi>as it were,</hi> moving him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto) nor without ſome fit ends whereat he aimeth, and for which he giveth way to them. By fit ends, I mean, fit in reſpect, either of his own honour and glory, or of the good of God's people, or of ſome of them. Now concerning this matter, I beſeech you, Friends, as ye deſire to eſcape, and to have your Brethren eſcape God's wrath, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to, and conſider, what I ſhall ſay unto you.</p>
            <p>Take heed ye be not deceived by the grand Impoſtors; <hi>Satan, the Fleſh, Sin, the World and your own hearts.</hi> For, 1. <hi>Satan</hi> did beguile <hi>Eve through his (Serpentine) ſubtilty,</hi> Gen 3. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 3. even when
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:151856:9"/> he had nothing in her (<hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 30.) and doth blind the eyes of many, leſt the light of the Goſpel ſhould ſhine unto them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. 2. The fleſh luſteth againſt the ſpirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. as it were, continually, and our worldly luſts are to the eyes of the mind, as duſt (ſtirred up by a Regiment of Horſe marching) (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 11.) or ſmoak to the eyes of the body; keeping us from diſcerning ſo clearly as otherwiſe we might, between truth and error, and hiding the truth from us; and <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 32. the old man is ſaid to be <hi>corrupt according to the deceitful laſts.</hi> 3. Becauſe ſin is very deceitful, therefore the Apoſtle calls on us, to exhort one another daily, <hi>leſt any of us be hardened through the deceitfulneſs of ſin,</hi> Heb. 3. 13. 4. The world alſo (if ye take not great heed) will hide your eyes from your own ſins, and deceive you, as it did <hi>Demas, 2 Tim.</hi> 4. 10. 5. Laſtly, the heart of man <hi>is deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful above all things,</hi> Jer 17. 9. ſo that <hi>he that truſteth in his own heart, is a fool,</hi> Prov. 28. 26.</p>
            <p>Verily, Friends, we are (through ſelf-love and folly) apt o im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> our afflictions to many things, rather than to our ſins, and every man, in a time of common calamities, to the ſins of others, rather than to his own, and we who are called Phanaticks, <hi>to impute</hi> the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions which are common to us with others, <hi>wholly to the ſins of others, and in no meaſure to our own ſins.</hi> And I believe, many a man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of you doth not know, and duly conſider, how far forth the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of this time be to be imputed to his and her ſins: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I beſeech you again, yea, <hi>I charge</hi> you <hi>before God, and the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, who ſhall judge the living and the dead at his appearing, and his Kingdom;</hi> all of you, take all due care, and give all diligence, to know why, and to what ends it is, that God hath and doth afflict us; and particularly, every one of you, to diſcern what hand his ſins and failings have had in bringing the ſaid afflictions upon us, and to <hi>hear the Rod, and [him] who hath appointed it,</hi> Mic. 6. 9.</p>
            <p>Now, if ye would know, what ends God aimeth at in afflicting us, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> let us firſt know, <hi>what ends he aimeth at in afflicting men</hi> (indefinitely) Profeſſors, or not Profeſſors. And for this;</p>

As all things are of him, and for him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 36. as he made <hi>all things</hi> for himſelf, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 4. ſo, being a God of judgment, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30. 18. he doth all his works in wiſdom, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. 24. and in them all, aimeth at his own glory, or the good of thoſe whom he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to his Son, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28. or both. 2. But, ſpeaking more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, God ſends men puniſhments, chaſtiſements and troubles, for theſe cauſes and ends:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That men may know and acknowledge, That the Kingdom <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:151856:10"/> over all the creatures, is his, and that he ruleth all the earth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 58. 12. &amp; 59. 13. <hi>Iſa. 2. 17. Ezek.</hi> 6. 12, 23. &amp; 22. 49.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To manifeſt his power, and that his threatnings recorded in the holy Scriptures be not in vain and of none effect, <hi>Exod. 9. 16. Rom. 9. 17. Lev. 10. 1, 2, 3. Ezek. 29. 49. Joh. 9. 2, 3. Rom. 11. 22. Ezek.</hi> 6. 10.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As a ſure and certain teſtimony of his righteous judgment to come, 2 <hi>Theſs. 1. 4, 5. 1 Pet.</hi> 4. 17, 18.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That by them the ſins of thoſe who are afflicted, may be broken off, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 41. &amp; 23. 47.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That the hypocriſie and rottenneſs of ſome Profeſſors may be made manifeſt, 2 <hi>Tim. 3. 9. Jud.</hi> v. 12. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 5, 6, 20, 21.</p>
            <p n="6">6. To make men call their ſins, it may be <hi>old ſins,</hi> to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38. the title, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to ſearch and try their wayes, to find out their ſins, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 40. and to make them fear God, and ſeek un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him for mercy and favour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to take heed of ſinning againſt him, and of provoking him to anger, <hi>Prov. 3. 12. Heb. 12. 6. Rev. 3. 19. Pſal. 94. 12. Hoſ.</hi> 5. 14. 15. with 6. 1, 2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 61, 71, 75.

            <p n="7">7. That the Saints may be made <hi>conform</hi> to their Head, our Lord <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/> Jeſus Chriſt in his ſufferings, <hi>Rom. 8. 17. Phil. 3. 10. Col. 1. 24. 1 Pet.</hi> 2, 21. &amp; 4. 13, 15, 16.</p>
            <p n="8">8. For the trial of their graces, faith in Gods promiſes, love to Chriſt, fear of God, patience, <hi>&amp;c. Jam. 1. 2. 12. Gen. 22. 10, 12. Job</hi> 1. &amp; 2. &amp;c. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 11. which if they be real and ſtrong, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the honour and glory of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 6, 7. and to make them know, what naughty things be in their hearts. To which end God once left <hi>Hezekiah, 2 Chron.</hi> 32. 31.</p>
            <p n="9">9. For the bettering of our ſpiritual eſtates, <hi>Rom. 8. 28. Heb. 12. 9, 10. Pſal.</hi> 94. 12.</p>
            <p n="10">10. That the courage and patience of ſome Saints under the Croſs, may be a good example to their fellow-Saints; that, their faith, comfort, courage and ſpiritual ſtrength being augmented, they alſo may ſeek for glory, and honour, and immortality, by the like patient continuance in well-doing, 2 <hi>Cor. 1. 6. Col.</hi> 1. 24.</p>
            <p n="11">11. <hi>God afflicteth both godly and ungodly perſons, becauſe of their ſins, Iſa. 59. 1, 2. Jer. 5. 25.

            <p n="12">
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:151856:10"/>12. God afflicts men of both ſorts for their ſins; that, their ſins be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23"/> bitter to them, they may reform their wayes according to Gods word, and the mind of Chriſt, and be made in a greater meaſure par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of Gods holineſs, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5. 14, 15. &amp; 6. 1, 2, 3. <hi>Pſal. 119. 75, 71. Heb.</hi> 12. 8, 10.</p>
            <p n="13">13. And, that the Saints may not be condemned with the world, <hi>Heb. 12. 9. 1 Cor.</hi> 11. 32.</p>
            <p n="14">14. As alſo to encreaſe our patience, experience and hope, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 3, 4, 5. and humility and meekneſs, to endure the wrath of God and rage of men, with a contented, quiet and calm ſpirit, and that we may be eſtabliſhed, ſtrengthened, ſetled; which work is ſeldom done thorowly without ſuffering a while, as <hi>Peter</hi> ſeems to intimate, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 9, 10. as a hedge-maker ſhakes the ſtakes, that he may faſten them in hedges.</p>
            <p n="15">15. Furthermore, we are troubled by the world, that we may not expect favour and peace from it, <hi>Joh. 16. 33. Luke</hi> 7. 31, 32, 34.</p>
            <p n="16">16. That we may not truſt in our ſelves, but in God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. 3. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 9, 10.</p>
            <p n="17">17. That effectual fervent petitions may be put up to God for them who are afflicted, by themſelves and others, <hi>Act. 12. 5. 2 Cor.</hi> 1. 11.</p>
            <p n="18">18. That, comfort and deliverance being beſtowed on them by the means of many, praiſe and thanks may be given to God on their behalf by many, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 11.</p>
            <p n="19">19. Our heavenly Father doth by our afflictions and the gracious operation of his <hi>holy Spirit,</hi> as it were by fire, conſume, and ſcoure, and cleanſe away, out of us, our droſs, ſcum, dirt, dung and all our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual filthineſs, <hi>Iſa. 27. 9. 1 Cor. 3. 15. 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12. 6. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66. 10, 11. &amp;c. <hi>Iſa. 1. 25.

            <p n="20">20. He afflicts ſome who have not given due diligence to be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of his fatherly love, (I believe) to make them more ſenſible of the want and benefits of that aſſurance, and to make them beſtow more time and care to attain it.</p>
            <p n="21">21. God plagues the ungodly ſometimes, that the Saints may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in and before God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 52. 5, 6. &amp; 68. 4.</p>
            <p n="22">22. Sometimes the Saints do ſuffer afflictions to ſeal and confirm <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> Goſpel-truths (<hi>John 3. 33. Mar. 16. 20. Heb.</hi> 2. 4.)</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But <hi>for which of all theſe cauſes or ends doth God afflict us that go under the name of profeſſors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If any man thinks that God doth afflict ſome of us for the firſt five things, I ſhall not peremptorily reject his opinion; and that partly, becauſe, I believe many of our profeſſors be <hi>meer Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts,</hi> and wholly deſtitute of true godlineſs: which therefore I believe, ſee <hi>Marg.</hi> 125, 126, 127, 128.</p>
            <p>2. I believe God hath, and doth afflict many godly perſons for all the reſt of the ends, excepting the 21 and 22. And if any think God hath done it to drive pride out of very many of us, I ſhall <hi>readily and chearfully</hi> ſubſcribe to that, but with this earneſt requeſt to every one that is of that opinion, to conſider <hi>as wiſely as he poſſibly can, whether he be one of them:</hi> but whether we ſhall be exalted or no, I know not.</p>
            <p>To ſpeak more plainly;</p>
            <p>True it is, ſpeaking in a general manner, the ſins of the Nation <hi>in general,</hi> may well be looked on as the cauſe of the common calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Nation. But</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>afflictions and grievances</hi> which are <hi>peculiar to us</hi> who are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="26"/> called <hi>Profeſſors</hi> and <hi>Phanaticks,</hi> the moſt forcible and prevalent cauſe of the beginning and continuance of them, the ſtrongeſt impediment of our Petitions for Liberty, Peace, and Proſperity (the <hi>cauſa ſine qua non</hi>) the cauſe without which things would not be with us, as they be, and that hath the moſt conſiderable hand in with-holding good things from us; is (I believe) <hi>the ſins of Profeſſors.</hi>
            </p>

Sure the cauſe is naught: For they ought to eſteem <hi>a reproof, a kindneſs,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145. 5. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 32, 33. But <hi>men cannot endure to have their friends ill ſpoken of.</hi> Therefore alſo it is, that ſome, when they ſee their ſins, yet will not ſeem to ſee them; yea, it may be, when their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences do tell them, that the Preacher means them, yet they will not ſeem to be <hi>of the ſame mind with their conſcience.</hi> Like Dr. <hi>Ferne,</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:151856:22"/> who when it was intimated to him, that he was aimed at, would whine out, <hi>He doth not mean me, He doth not mean me.</hi> And ſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it comes to paſs, that the Preachers words be heard in vain, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 1.</p>
            <p>14. Our ſins are alſo greatened <hi>by God's wrath and vengeance</hi> upon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="76"/> others, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 18. &amp;c. but eſpecially upon our ſelves and others, at home and abroad, by Sea and by Land, in City and Country, by the Sword, Peſtilence, Fire, &amp;c. We ought to hear Rods of no great roughneſs, and without a heavy load of Afflictions, ſo as to cleanſe our wayes, and to let go our ſins, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27. 7, 8, 9. But <hi>the Sword, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence, Burning of houſes,</hi> and the like, do <hi>call on us amain, and with a very loud voice,</hi> even for a full and compleat cleanſing of all our wayes to the uttermoſt. To ſpeak home; <hi>The Lord hath proved us,</hi> as he did the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in divers manners, (<hi>Deut.</hi> 8. 2. &amp;c.) ſome of us ſharply, before the late civil Wars, and in the time of the Wars with loſſes and proſperity. Plainly, he hath tried us very variouſly, with adverſity, and proſperity, and adverſity; and <hi>we have</hi> dealt with him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="77"/> as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95. 9, 10, 11. <hi>proved and tempted him, and do ſtill tempt him, with our ſins;</hi> notwithſtanding we have ſeen <hi>the great and ſtrange works</hi> which he hath wrought <hi>for us, and againſt us.</hi> He hath drawn us (with cords of love) and we have not been drawn; and driven us (with Rods) and we have not been driven; purged us, and we have not been purged, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24. 13. and humbled us, and we have not been humbled. We have not humbled our ſelves as we ought to have done, but are (many of us) <hi>haughty and high-minded, jolly and jocund, followers of new and gaudy faſhions.</hi> We do adorn and <hi>trimour bodies and houſes with things too fine, and too coſtly.</hi> Can this be without <hi>Rebellion,</hi> which is as the ſin of <hi>Witch craft?</hi> and without ſtubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which is as <hi>Iniquity</hi> and <hi>Idolatry?</hi> (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 22.) or without <hi>deſpiſing the chaſtening</hi> of the Lord? <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 5. What? not learn obedience by the ſore things which we ſuffer? Why, it was a foul fault in <hi>Iſrael, to put far away an evil day</hi> which was not yet come upon them, <hi>Amos</hi> 6. 3. What is it then in us, to carry our ſelves, as if it were very far from us, when not only an evil day is actually upon us, but alſo we have juſt cauſe to think, ſome men will endeavour to make it much ſorer, and more terrible than it is? But, Oh, what hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="78"/> already been done (with God's permiſſion) at <hi>London,</hi> ſince <hi>they who above all others, ſhould have stood in the gap, and taken pains to make up the hedge, have disfigured themſelves!</hi> O Lord God, what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of us?</p>
            <pb n="33" facs="tcp:151856:22"/>
            <p>15. Our iniquity is <hi>greatly greatned</hi> by partaking of other mens ſins. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. As it is a ſin to command, or counſel, or hire, or requeſt, or ſeek by threatnings, or ſharp words, or promiſes, and fair words, to draw or drive any manner of perſon to do any unlawful work, or to ſpeak any unlawful word, or to omit any part of his duty, ſo, if the party ſo tempted, ſhall yield to the Temptation, then he who hath by any ſuch ways prevailed with him, or ſhall abet, maintain, or countenance a man in any ſin, is acceſſary to the ſin which is committed, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of it with the perſonal Actor of it.</p>

            <p n="4">4. We are partakers of other mens, not only by being evil exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to them, but alſo by not being good examples to them. And, O how often do we treſpaſs in the three laſt of theſe wayes, eſpecially in the laſt of all!</p>
            <p>Yet give me leave, to ſpeak ſomewhat more to you of <hi>ſome Goſpel-matters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many Profeſſors, ſome unregenerate, and ſome (I believe) rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, do not make ſuch uſe as they ought, of the Doctrine, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, Promiſes and <hi>threatnings</hi> of the Goſpel.</p>

And thus far of the ſixth part of my proof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Part.</hi> 7. 1. There are five ſins of Profeſſors, whereof I ſhall here <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="80"/> ſpeak together (notwithſtanding I have already ſpoken of ſome of them) becauſe they be ſo common.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Many Profeſſors, <hi>Miniſters</hi> and others, do <hi>neglect their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,</hi> not beſtowing time and pains in <hi>educating and training up their children and ſervants</hi> in the way wherein they ſhould go, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22. 6. (as if they did believe the Devils old ſaying, <hi>A young Saint, and an old Devil.</hi>) O how careleſs many Profeſſors be, of preparing thoſe who ſhall ſurvive them, to <hi>hold forth the name of Chriſt in a holy manner,</hi> to his honour and the credit of his Goſpel!</p>
            <p n="2">2. Many Profeſſors do ſuffer very much <hi>frothy, vain, idle, fooliſh, corrupt communication, not tending to edification, to proceed out of their mouths.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Many Profeſſors do <hi>profane and miſpend much of the holy Salbaths.</hi> For which ſin and Idolatry eſpecially, (as the <hi>Jews</hi> about two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years ſince have ſaid) the Lord did reject their Fore-fathers; ſo that (as they then ſaid) they could not take the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of thoſe days
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:151856:23"/> 
               <hi>to be the ſervants of the true Meſſias,</hi> becauſe they did live in thoſe two ſins.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Many <hi>Profeſſors</hi> be <hi>ſo full of pride</hi> under this Diſpenſation, that by reaſon of it and <hi>the fruits of it,</hi> men of knowledge can hardly get cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity enough, to think there is any fear of God before their eyes.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It is a common thing with Profeſſors, to be ſilent at the ſins one of another. Which five things joyned together, do amount to a foul heap of iniquity.</p>
            <p>Part. 8. I come now to ſome <hi>down-right Reaſons</hi> for this my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="81"/> that <hi>the greateſt cauſe of the afflictions peculiar to Profeſſors, and the greateſt impediment of their prayers for ſome good things expedient for them, u the ſins and iniquities of Profeſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>R.</hi> 1. And firſt, Gods Kingdom, Wiſdom, and Power being ſuch as it is, and all mens hearts and times being in his hand, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21. 1. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31. 15. he might have eſtabliſhed our King in all his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and yet given us favour with him and his Parliaments (as <hi>Gen.</hi> 39. 4, 5, 6, 21, 22, 23. &amp; <hi>Dan.</hi> 1. 6.) and bowed their hearts, to confirm us in the places which we held 1659. with the means and liberty which we then enjoyed (excepting the Kings revenue and ſome high Offices.) Neither hath it been at any time ſuch a hard thing for God, to better our Eſtates, <hi>inſtead</hi> whereof, notwithſtanding <hi>Gods-love to his children, which paſſeth knowledge,</hi> Eph. 3. 19 and that <hi>the effectual</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="82"/> 
               <hi>fervent prayer of the righteous availeth much with him,</hi> Jam. 5. 16. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet, it hath pleaſed him, in his infinite wiſdom, to afflict Profeſſors in divers kinds, wherein he hath not afflicted others; yea, to afflict us in our worldly Eſtates, and to encreaſe the means of growing rich to others; yea, to augment the worldly Eſtates of others by diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ours, to deprive us of our Benefices, Offices, and Preferments, to make room for others: yea, ye know, that ſince 1659. notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we have carryed our ſelves, <hi>not ſeditiouſly, but peaceably and quietly,</hi> yet our condition is by degrees and ſteps grown from good to bad, and from bad to worſe. Which ſorry changes of our condition, to what others <hi>may make a ſhift,</hi> to impute them, I know not; but, in my judgment, they are to be aſcribed to our ſins, who are called Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, of whom (I believe) many are not yet born again, and many Sons and Daughters have and do by their ſins provoke our heavenly Father, to chaſtiſe and correct them.</p>
            <p>For R. 1. Although the Lord ſcourgeth every Son (<hi>and Daughter</hi>) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="83"/> whom he receiveth, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 6. yet he doth not afflict, or grieve, ſo much as one man or woman <hi>meerly for his pleaſure,</hi> Lam. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:151856:24"/> are right;</hi> he afflicts them in faithfulneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 57. becauſe (<hi>according to his juſt and wiſe Method</hi> of making men meet to partake of the inheritance of the Saints in light, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 12, 13.) there is (as <hi>Peter</hi> calls it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 6.) <hi>need,</hi> either becauſe they be not duly care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and diligent, to find out their ſins, or becauſe they be ſo far from hating ſin as they ought, as not to be throughly careful to humble themſelves for and to ceaſe from ſome of thoſe ſins whereof they be <hi>guilty (Exod.</hi> 34. 6, 7.) <hi>or elſe for that</hi> they do not uſe due care and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to reach and attain ſome other end which they ought to ſeek (if this clauſe doth contain any thing which the former clauſes do not.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>R.</hi> 2. A ſinful agreement between Profeſſors. About forty years <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="84"/> ſince, if the Commonalty did miſ-behave themſelves, and the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates</hi> did <hi>not puniſh</hi> them for it, nor the <hi>Ministers reprove</hi> them for it; this, <hi>they who were taught of God,</hi> did look on, as a fore runner of Gods wrath, even as a ſign, that it was near at hand. The reaſon of which opinion muſt of neceſſity be this, that ſuch a <hi>conſpiracy</hi> is too like, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. 30, 31. and doth provoke the <hi>LORD</hi> of Hoſts unto great wrath, (<hi>Acts</hi> 5. 9.) Which if it be true, (as, I believe, it is) then we may well receive this for a truth, that the nearer we Profeſſors come to ſuch a helliſh <hi>conſent,</hi> the more probable it is, that the wrath of God will ſeize upon us, if it be not already upon us: and, if it be, that this our <hi>conſent</hi> hath brought it upon us, or, at leaſt, as much of it as is peculiar to us. And the very truth is, the ſinful agreement which is between many of us, is too like ſuch <hi>a conſpiracy</hi> as the holy Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> in that Chapter, <hi>ver.</hi> 30. calls a wonderful and horrible thing. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the time of the Interruption, I took notice wherein <hi>O. Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="85"/> 
               <hi>and our Parliaments, Armies, Commitees, Commiſſioners, and Aſſembly of Divines,</hi> and particular perſons, <hi>Round-heads,</hi> &amp;c. did miſs the right, and did what they ought not to have done; among other things, over-recompenſing their members for their loſſes [one Father and Son (as I have heard) with 5000 <hi>l.</hi> for the (pure) loſs of about or leſs than 5 <hi>l.</hi>].</p>
            <p n="2">2. Since that time the Covetouſneſs, Pride, and Iniquity of many Profeſſors hath been very conſiderable.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Whereof hath been no ſmall part, the <hi>Faſhionmonging</hi> of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, and particularly, the gay <hi>Lady-like attire and ornaments of ſhop-keeping women in London.</hi> But it is ſaid concerning them, that <hi>London</hi> doth allow, what other Towns do not. It may be ſo: howſoever, and although <hi>London hath been my Benefactor,</hi> yet I ſhall not juſtifie the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:151856:24"/> proudeſt of the <hi>Londoners</hi> in taking an Ell, yea, or half an Ell, or a quarter of an Ell, when they be allowed but an inch, eſpecially <hi>at ſuch a time of Adverſity as this is.</hi> I had rather they would conſider ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly concerning <hi>Apparel and Ornaments</hi> that which is written by <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 9, 10. and by <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 3, 4, 5. praying and taking good heed, leſt they be weighed in the ballances and found wanting, (<hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 27.) it may be to be nothing, (<hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 3.) leſt <hi>London</hi> be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the ſtate of ſome other Cities, and that they fare as was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1. 8. &amp; <hi>Eſ.</hi> 3. 17. to the 24.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The children and ſervants of many religious Families, being rude, profane, and irreligious, the Heads of ſuch Families, who have autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over them, (ſomewhat like that of Magiſtrates and Miniſters over the members of ſeveral Families) do not uſe their authority in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing, rebuking, and correcting them for their diſorderly beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As ſome Conforming Miniſters be godly, ſo I believe ſome Non-conforming Miniſters be altogether deſtitute of true godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Whereas Miniſters ought to be <hi>an example of the believers, in word, in converſation, in ſpirit, in faith, in purity,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 12. <hi>and a pattern of good works;</hi> inſtead thereof (according to my hearing, and in part, ſeeing) ſome Miniſters have been, and ſome are little leſs than patterns and examples of Covetouſneſs, Pride, and Vanity. <hi>London Miniſters</hi> of great means heretofore did pay Country Miniſters for preaching for them, with <hi>leaning on their Velvet Cuſhions.</hi> One Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter being offered 100 <hi>l.</hi> to preach one Sermon weekly, ſaid, that was but a journey-mans wages.

               <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> the Lord, and in the knowledge and love of his Truths, and invincibly reſolved to cleave in love to him and them for ever: They have truſted in themſelves, and in the world, expecting (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any good cauſe) favour and peace from it.

They have not been duly thankful to God for their liberty and peace, and the comforts, helps and deliverances which he hath vouchſaſed them in diſtreſſes and dangers, nor prayed and given thanks for one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers comforts under the Croſs, deliverances and peace; at leaſt, as they ought to have done, and ſhould have done, if we had been knit together with brotherly love, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 2. They have not exerciſed and ſhewn forth their graces and ſpiritual gifts as they ſhould have done; for the encreaſing of them and the honour of Chriſt, eſpecially their Faith, Zeal for God and his people, Humility and Patience. They have not prayed mightily for the deſtruction of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and of the Kingdom of Antichriſt. They have not uſed all due diligence, to find and know <hi>all</hi> the naughty things which are in their hearts, nor taken due care to know, which of thoſe he hath and doth moſt favour, and endeavoured very ſeriouſly to beat it down. My meaning is, that, of the ſaid ſins and faults, ſome Profeſſors be guilty of theſe, and ſome of thoſe, and <hi>ſome of many.</hi> (The truth is, Profeſſors be ſo ſanity in their Hair and the Apparel, and the Ornaments of the body, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning other matters, that it is a very difficult thing for us Miniſters (the Lord be merciful to us) to learn, how to do our duty in ſeeking to reform them.)</p>
            <p>9. So that in the ninth and laſt place, if we would know, what it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="94"/> concerns us to do towards the bettering of our eſtates; the way is, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Profeſſor to amend thoroughly of the ſins and faults before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, as many as he himſelf is guilty of, and to perform every duty which is contrary to any of them.</p>

               <hi>God of judgement?</hi> Is it not, becauſe he knows how long it is fit for him to wait, and how long he hath waited, and when it is good for us, that he ſhould ceaſe from correcting us?

            <p>Alſo I have been credibly informed, that one of the fore-runners of the enſlaving of <hi>Rochel</hi> 1628. was the miſpending and profaning of the afternoon of the <hi>Lord</hi>'s day, and the <hi>ſlighting</hi> or worſe of the beſt Miniſters; and that one of the fore-runners of the late long War in <hi>Germany</hi> 1620. &amp;c. was very groſs profaneneſs, &amp;c.

            <p>3. I believe, were it not for our ſins, it would not be withus, as it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="164"/> is, It is the <hi>cauſa ſine qua non</hi> of our, &amp;c.</p>

But, methinks, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and wiſe perſons <hi>cannot ſee</hi> any ſufficient cauſe, to deſire ſuch times.</p>
            <p>5. The iſſue is this; either attend to the inſtructions of <hi>faithful</hi> Miniſters, and reform, and take heed to thy waies according to the word of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 9. or elſe look not for deliverance, &amp;c. but additional afflictions and puniſhments, according to the threatenings, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26. 14. to the 39. and get <hi>a very ſtrong faith, and much humility,</hi> (that thou mayeſt poſſeſs thy ſoul <hi>under the Plows and Harrows</hi> in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience:) <hi>which one who is not thoroughly reformed, will hardly attain.</hi>

            <p>1. That upon <hi>Abab's external humiliation,</hi> God did not bring the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:151856:41"/> upon his houſe in his daies, but in the daies of his ſon, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21. 29.</p>

               <hi>A.</hi> Art thou content to have thy whole portion of good things (as wicked men have theirs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17. 14.) in this life, and to go, whither <hi>Ahab</hi> went at the time of his death, and to have the heads of 70 of thy ſons within a few years after, put into baskets? 2 <hi>King.</hi> 10. I think thou art not.</p>
            <p>2. That God hearkened to King <hi>Hezekiah's</hi> prayer, and healed the people, who were not cleanſed according to the purification of the Sanctuary, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. 18, 19, 20.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Is this any thing to thee? He <hi>prayed only for thoſe who prepered their hearts to ſeek God, the Lord God of their Fathers,</hi> v. 18, 19. ſo that <hi>they did prepare their hearts,</hi> and the only thing which they wanted, was a ceremonial cleanſing, which alſo they wanted not, becauſe they were not willing to perform it, but becauſe they wanted time to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it; and <hi>he whoſe heart is prepared,</hi> will not neglect the preparing of his waies. And, as for thee, <hi>if thy heart be duly prepared</hi> to ſeek the Lord, thou mayeſt really reſolve to amend thy carriage, as far forth as it is faulty, <hi>as it were, in a moment:</hi> yea know, that thy heart is not duly prepared, unleſs thou be willing and careful to find out thy ſins, and to reform all the parts of thy converſation.</p>
            <p>3. That God, ſeeing what the <hi>Ninevites</hi> did, turned from his fierce <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="166"/> wrath, and did not deſtroy them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It was <hi>much,</hi> which they did; more than ſome Profeſſors do: they believed God, obſerved a Faſt very ſolemnly, cried mightily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, and turned from their evil waies, Chap. 3. 5. &amp;c.

And yet God did but ſuſpend the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his ſentence againſt them; for their <hi>City was deſtroyed;</hi> I think, ſome ſay, about 40 years after: and <hi>many of you</hi> would be loth to have your own houſes deſtroyed forty years hence.</p>
            <p>4. That doubtleſs exceeding many of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were great ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="167"/> when they came out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> yet God wrought for them mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>5. That God would have ſpared <hi>Sodom,</hi> if there had been but ten <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="168"/> righteous perſons in it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 32.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> But he hath not bound himſelf by a Law, to deal with all other places according to that rate.</p>
            <p>6. That Profeſſors do pray.</p>

            <p>(1) 1. Let Miniſters and <hi>ſome other fit perſons</hi> meet ſometimes apart <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="210"/> by themſelves. 2. <hi>Let all theſe</hi> give due diligence to be <hi>exemplary in their converſation,</hi> to be <hi>excellent</hi> patterns, fit for other Profeſſors to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate. 3. <hi>At thoſe meetings,</hi> let it be conſidered; That the carriage of many Profeſſors is ſo full of <hi>ſins of Omiſſion</hi> and commiſſion, that there is juſt cauſe of admoniſhing them thereof, for their own good, God's honour, and the good of the Church; that ſome of their ſins do tend more than others, to God's diſhonour, and more diſcredit Religion, and more provoke God's wrath; that ſome Profeſſors be blind; ſome lame, or lamiſh; ſome dumb, or as it were tongue-tied; ſome dull, and heavy, and ſlow; ſome proud; ſome too full of mirth and jol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; ſome worldly and covetous; ſome peradventure covetous <hi>three wayes;</hi> ſome aſleep, or not thorougly awakened; ſome <hi>ſtark dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, meer Formaliſts;</hi> and that, for ſome of theſe evil qualities ſome Profeſſors be affected <hi>with</hi> them in a greater meaſure than others. Alſo <hi>at ſuch Meetings,</hi> let it be reſolved, what fit <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="211"/> means ſhall (God willing) be uſed by <hi>this company,</hi> to heal and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form ſuch Profeſsors, but to deal with them all, <hi>as their ſtates re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</hi> (See 1 <hi>Cor,</hi> 4. 21. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 14. 1 <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 11, 12, 13. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 2.) and that ſpecial care ſhall be taken, to find out, and quell, and beat down thoſe ſins which do moſt irritate the Almighty, and moſt weaken and hinder prayers, in regard of the ſin it ſelf, or its aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, and <hi>that every Profeſſors heart may be ſet againſt his deareſt ſin;</hi> (which is that which he doth moſt favour, and moſt ſpare, and <hi>leaſt,</hi> or not at all ſtrive, wreſtle and fight againſt. To that effect <hi>Edward Green,</hi> and rightly, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 11.) (which ſetting of the heart ſo <hi>againſt that ſin,</hi> is a ſign of true grace.) Let it <hi>there alſo</hi> be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, who of thoſe that uſe to meet with this ſmall company, be fit to be reproved or admoniſhed, and of what fault, and who of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:151856:49"/> this ſmall company, ſhall deal with <hi>M.</hi> and who with <hi>N.</hi> &amp;c. and what, tending to the reformation of Profeſſors, every one of them ſhall perform, and by what times, and that they will all of them <hi>hearken,</hi> to hear and know the iſſue of their endeavours, former and latter; (as <hi>Jeremy</hi> did, Chap. 8. 6.) that they may proceed, as there ſhall be occaſion. <hi>Let it there</hi> alſo be concluded, that due care ſhall be taken by this ſmall company to deſtroy and remove the cauſes, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="212"/> occaſions of the irregular converſation of Profeſſors; ſuch as are (I think) <hi>ignorance, unfaithfulneſs, carnal and worldly fear, diffidence, (not trusting in God) careleſsneſs and negligence, (not conſidering our ſelves and others, &amp;c.) pride, covetouſneſs, voluptuouſneſs, (not content with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, &amp;c.) ſinful ſilence, and holding our peace at the fault sone of another, luke-warmneſs</hi> and want of zeal for <hi>Christ</hi> and his Church. Theſe are part of the cauſes, &amp;c. <hi>in Miniſters</hi> and others. (Nay, 'tis true.) To which may be added, preaching without due conſideration of the Hearers (that's worthy to be mentioned twice) and without due pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.</p>
            <p>And as to Ignorance, my experience and charity tells me, that even <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="213"/> ſome <hi>Preachers</hi> be (in part) <hi>ignorant</hi> of the doctrine of <hi>things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, apparel and ornaments of the body, conformity to the world, appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of evil,</hi> things lovely and of good report, and peradventure of the doctrine of ſanctifying <hi>the Sabbath,</hi> and <hi>the uſe of the Tongue,</hi> which yet may be gathered up and underſtood in and by theſe Scriptures, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3. 18. &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 14. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 9, 10. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 3, 4, 5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 2. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 22. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 8, 9. <hi>Exra</hi> 20. 8. &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. 13, 14. <hi>Mat.</hi> 12, 36, 37. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 10. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 25, 29, 30, 31. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 26. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 15. concerning which things very many Profeſſors, and <hi>ſome Miniſters</hi> are faulty.</p>
            <p>(2). Let this ſmall company draw to ſome extraordinary Meetings, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="214"/> as many as they can, of thoſe with whom any of them uſe to hold or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Meetings, whether (in their judgment) as a Church, or not; and (if they judge it convenient) ſome others alſo. At which extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Meetings, let ſome of them declare and publiſh, that notice is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the carriage of many Profeſſors, that it is not ſuch as it ought to be; and that ye who are Miniſters, have reſolved, to endeavour, that thoſe things which are amiſs, may be amended, and that they do earneſtly deſire and requeſt all that are preſent, to contribute, what they can, every one of them, to the reformation of Profeſſors, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of thoſe of his or her own ſociety: Whereto let one of you add an Exhortation, perſwading all that are preſent (as vigorouſly and effectually as he ſhall be able) ſo to do. After which Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="215"/>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:151856:50"/> and a prayer ſuitable to it, <hi>let all that are preſent,</hi> mutually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and engage, <hi>as before the moſt high God,</hi> one to another, every one of them to all the reſt, to watch over one another, and to take care one of anothers ſpiritual eſtate, <hi>dealing</hi> one with another concerning it <hi>faithfully,</hi> and in particular to mind one another of ſins and duties, committed or omitted, or to be done, as they ſhall apprehend to be their duty; as alſo <hi>to take admonitions and reproofs well in worth,</hi> and in good part, one from another. All this may be ſignified by lifting up the hand, or by any other ſign convenient. Alſo at this Meeting, ye may do well to warn all the company, to amend their wayes, to the uttermoſt of their knowledge and abilities, and to let them know, that they may expect to have their ſins handled and ſpoken of hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (as there is or ſhall be juſt cauſes) both at Meetings and privately, but <hi>in a fit manner, and as ſhall be expedient for the credit of the perſons admoniſhed;</hi> and that if the Miniſters ſhall underſtand, that any of them be reſolved, and do begin to endeavour to amend any fault, that thenceforth they be not to expect any reproof for that fault.</p>
            <p>(3.) When there is any real Reformation of any Family or perſon, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="216"/> let hearty thanks be fittingly given by many (with true ſpiritual joy and gladneſs in their hearts) to God, who gives the encreaſe to the planters and waterers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5, 6, 7. <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 3. <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 8. And let the ſucceſs encourage you, to go forward with the good work, which ye have in hand, chearfully.</p>
            <p>And now, I beſeech all Profeſſors, to enter upon this neceſſary bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of reforming forthwith, (without any procraſtination or delay) <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. 46, 47, 48. and to do every part of it (as all works of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and all we do for God, ought to be done) ſeriouſly and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, and in the fear of God (away with all trifling;) and not to neglect it, till ye have compleated, every one his and her part of it. For ye know not, how ſoon a priſon-houſe, or fear of it, or the grave <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="217"/> may hinder you, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9. 10. <hi>Zech.</hi> 1. 5. As for theſe and the reſt of my Inſtructions, ye may (for many of you are able) amend them, and add to them, and hold them forth to others in a more winning manner, than I have done, unto the exaltation of our great Maſter <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and the benefit of his people: but, I pray you, give me not cauſe, by your ill dealing with him and them, <hi>to mourn in ſecret</hi> for your luke-warmneſs and unfaithfulneſs, and for the evils which may come to you and yours. For if my counſel be evil in your eyes, I ſhall look on your not hearkening to it, to do your duty for God and his Church, as a ſign of more wrath. But, I hope good things
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:151856:50"/> will be done by very many of you, even things tending to a great and bleſſed reformation, though I thus ſpeak.</p>
            <p>I <hi>come now,</hi> in the laſt place, to ſpeak <hi>ſomewhat more of reproving;</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="218"/> and the like, <hi>as one of the Middeſſes of reforming;</hi> and, although, in ſome caſes, we be bound to reprove them who are not called Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors; yet my buſineſs at this time being the amendment of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, I ſhall content my ſelf with this, that Profeſſors ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove Profeſſors for their ſins. And this I find to be the duty of Miniſters and Preachers, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 2. and of them and other Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. 17. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 15. <hi>R.</hi> And this thou who art a Profeſſor, oughteſt to do; 1.

If they be already in the ſtate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="219"/> of ſalvation; (<hi>which all Profeſſors are not</hi>) yet this is the way to better their ſpiritual eſtate, in reſpect of their faith, aſſurance, peace with God, peace with their own conſciences, ſpiritual joy and comfort, and encouragement, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 17. It is the way (if I may ſo ſpeak) to keep God from looking on them, as his enemies, and from <hi>wounding</hi> their very heads, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 68. 21. It is a good way indeed to encreaſe their happineſs in all reſpects, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84. 11. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. 3. For the benefit of the Church of God. For the more ſinleſs and pure of life any man is, 1.

For I have already ſhewn thee, that <hi>there is no little ſin, becauſe there is no little God.</hi> The true God is infinitely great and worthy, and every ſin is committed againſt him; therefore every ſin is great. See <hi>Marg.</hi> 30. 31. Moreover, I fear, many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors do make nothing of ſome of their little Treſpaſſes: and doth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="225"/> not this make them in Gods eſteem <hi>far the greater?</hi> Verily it doth. And what do they, that do not reprove them? what do they make of their ſins? Truly, <hi>the offender and non-reprover</hi> are in that too like one another. Beſide, many little ſins do yied but <hi>little (ſeeming) good fruit;</hi> and that greatens them, that we <hi>dare</hi> treſpaſs againſt the moſt high God, and his holy, juſt, and good Commandments, <hi>for ſuch poor matters,</hi> for trifles. And I have ſpoken unto you of the Profeſſors,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:151856:52"/> which in that great day ſhall be ſet on Chriſts left hand; of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of them, that they ſhall be <hi>damned for little ſins, and ſins about things indifferent.</hi> Take heed therefore, ye who uſe liberty, as an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the fleſh, and ye who are ſilent at ſuch mens ſins; take heed, I ſay, leſt ye be torn in pieces <hi>together,</hi> when there is none to deliver, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 22.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Repl.</hi> But ſome Profeſſors uſe to practiſe (as far as I ſee) only one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="226"/> ſin; it may be <hi>rotten or frothy talk:</hi> I hope it is <hi>no fault</hi> in me, to let them alone in one ſin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No fault? Why man, for how many and what faults did <hi>Jeſus Chriſt in the time of his low eſtate,</hi> reprove <hi>Martha?</hi> Lu. 10. 41, 42. I think, it was not for many, nor for great faults; yet he reproved her. And ſo did God <hi>for one fault,</hi> reprove <hi>Sarah,</hi> Gen. 18. 15. &amp;c. and <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 35. 1. and <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and <hi>Jehu,</hi> the Prophet <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> 2 Chron. 19. 2. and <hi>Paul, Peter,</hi> Gal. 2. 11. &amp;c. and <hi>an</hi> Angel, <hi>John,</hi> Rev. 19. 10. and 22, 9. Beſide 1. It may be, this or that Profeſſor doth practiſe more ſins, than thou knoweſt of. (He may favour his ſecret ſins.) 2. Being reproved for one ſin, that reproof may occaſion him to take notice of other ſins, which thou knoweſt not of. 3. Howſoever, reproof and inſtruction concerning one ſin, is a good way to keep him from making a Trade of many ſins, yea of any one ſin. If thou thinkeſt thy ſelf wiſer than <hi>Jehu</hi> the Prophet, and <hi>Paul;</hi> yet take heed of <hi>making thyſelf</hi> wiſer than <hi>Chriſt:</hi> for thou muſt ſtand before his judgment-ſeat; and he is a righteous Judge, and <hi>will bring to light the hidden things of darkneſs, and make manifeſt the counſels of the hearts,</hi> and condemn (I fear) many Profeſſors for <hi>idle words and</hi> the like <hi>(ſmall) ſins,</hi> which they do ſeldom or never <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly grieve for, or confeſs, and ask pardon of:</hi> which is an Argument, that they do in their hearts make ſmall matters of them; and the way (if I may ſo ſpeak) <hi>to make God</hi> look on them, <hi>as foul matters.</hi> Which I hold very fit to be thought of, and this alſo, that it is a very <hi>wretched</hi> thing for a man who <hi>thinks himſelf wiſe,</hi> to ſuffer any one of his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Profeſſors to be damned for one ſin.</p>
            <p>Another may ſay, I do ſay nothing to ſuch a Profeſſor, becauſe he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="227"/> is a <hi>Dog,</hi> or a <hi>Swine,</hi> Mat. 7. 6.</p>

               <hi>A.</hi> What a Profeſſor, and a <hi>Dog,</hi> or a <hi>Swine?</hi> Either of theſe is a very heavy charge, with which we muſt not without a very good ground, load any of thoſe who have gotten the name of Profeſſors, (no nor of them who have not neither.)</p>

               <hi>Repl.</hi> If he be not a <hi>Dog,</hi> or <hi>Swine,</hi> yet, if I ſhould reprove him, he would be angry with me, and not receive the good counſel which I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 words">

Take heed of proving thy ſelf, <hi>nothing,</hi> ver. 1. 2, 3. Verily if a man ſhould tell me, he would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive inſtruction; I think, I ſhould not abſolutely believe him. It <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="228"/> may be, he might be diſpleaſed and angry with me for a while, and afterward his ſecond thoughts might be better: (although I have known when, (I think, a Captain and a Lieutenant) have fairly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured my ſtout and blunt reproof in an Inn in <hi>London,</hi> for ſwearing.

               <hi>A.</hi> Do you ſo? What are you? Are you a <hi>Chriſtian?</hi> What is that then, which you profeſs? Is it <hi>carnal</hi> ſelf-love and ſelf-ſeeking? If it be ſo, then your ſilence doth not belie your profeſſion. But it may be, you think, you do love them, who love you, (as the <hi>Publicans</hi> did <hi>(Mat.</hi> 5. 46.) And is this thy kindneſs to thy Friends? Why man, thou oughteſt to miniſter ſpiritual things to them eſpecially, who mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter carnal and worldly things to thee: for that is one of the Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are upon thee. Yea, Friend, if thou ſeeſt <hi>the Aſs of thine enemy,</hi> lying under his burthen; thou oughteſt (ſurely) <hi>to leave thy buſineſs</hi> to help him, and if thou meet <hi>the Ox or Aſs</hi> of thy <hi>enemy</hi> going aſtray; thou oughteſt (ſurely) to bring it back again, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 4, 5. and canſt thou ſee <hi>the ſoul</hi> of thy Friend, who loveth thee (and thou pretendeſt to love him) canſt thou ſee his ſoul, going aſtray, and not cake ſome care and pains, to bring it back again? and ſee the ſoul of thy Benefactor lying under a burthen of ſin, and forbear to help it? Is this true love, and true Chriſtianity, not to take ſo much care and pains, to help <hi>thy Friends ſoul</hi> as thou oughteſt to help thy <hi>enemies Aſs?</hi> Surely, I know not, where this is true Chriſtian love, unleſs it be beyond the <hi>Antipodes,</hi> or where all the people be Heathens. For as for <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> they ought to have more reſpect to the ſouls one of another, than to the bodies. But alas, Friend, all this while, I have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="232"/> not remembred, that which thou and I ought in all our dealings with Profeſſors principally and above all other things to regard, to wit, the honour and intereſt of <hi>our moſt dear Friend Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Mat. 6. 9. 1 Cor. 10. 31.

            </p>
            <p>A. How long haſt thou been a Profeſſor, that thou <hi>haſt</hi> ſo little Charity? For he ought to love thee the more for thy Faithfulneſs <hi>(Prov.</hi> 27. 5, 6.) and the rather to make thee one of the Mrs. of his purſe. And why art thou ſo fooliſh and ſo ſlow, to believe what the Scripture hath ſpoken? Doth not the ſpirit of truth by <hi>Solomon</hi> ſay, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 23. that <hi>He who rebuketh a man, ſhall afterwards find

            </p>
            <p>A. That indeed is more, than <hi>moſt Profeſſors do;</hi> I think ſo, and that they do not judge, that there is need of any great <hi>Reformation.</hi> Yet that is but part of thy duty. This thou oughteſt to do, and not to omit reproof. And it may be, God hath not heard thy prayers for them, becauſe thou doſt not reprove them.</p>

               <hi>Apol.</hi> But peradventure one or two will ſay, they be not throughly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="234"/> reformed themſelves.</p>
            <p>A. Whoſe fault is that? Why doſt thou delay to cleanſe thy ways according to Gods rule? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 9. Neither do Chriſts words, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. or any other Scripture import, that unreformed or poorly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reformed Profeſſors be freed from the duty of exhorting and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving others: So that thy ſilence at other mens faults doth encreaſe thine iniquity.

               <hi>Obj.</hi> But, if I do tell others of their faults, then (belike) they will upbraid me with mine.</p>

               <hi>A.</hi> I could wiſh all thy near Neighbours and acquaintance would tell thee of them: then, it may be, thou wouldſt amend them, which would be far better for thee, than to ſuffer in Hell fire for them.</p>

One thing more ſome have inferred from the Coherence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="236"/> of the words, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. 17. <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>not to reprove is to hate:</hi> which inference, whether it be right or not; yet, if he who ſpareth his rod, doth, <hi>in the Language of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> hate his Son (as he doth; for that's the expreſſion, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 24.) then, in the Language of the Holy Ghoſt, he who ſpareth words of reproof, when he ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, <hi>hateth thoſe whom he ought to reprove;</hi> his Neighbours, Friends, Benefactors Profeſſors, and of what ſort ſoever they be. And I would not that Profeſſors ſhould hate one another, but reprove of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders; as the <hi>LORD</hi> himſelf did <hi>Sarah, Gen.</hi> 18. 12, 15. the Son of God, <hi>Martha, Luke</hi> 10. 41, 42. and the Angels the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>Aſia, Rev.</hi> 2. and 3. and the Holy Ghoſt doth the World, <hi>John</hi> 16. 8, 9. <hi>Nathan, David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. and <hi>Paul</hi> his fellow Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>Peter,</hi> Gal. 2.

Stir up in thy heart very much love of God, and much filial fear of God, and a ſtrong Affiance in God, and much brotherly love toward Profeſſors and the Church of God, eſpecially in reſpect of their ſpiritual welfare. For, if theſe five things be really in thee and do abound, they will make thee, that thou ſhalt <hi>neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> (2 Pet. 1. 8.) and particularly (whatſoever more may be ſaid of them) they will move thee effectually, to do, what I would fain have thee to do, (to labour to reform, to reprove, &amp;c.) and that, as thy duty, and alſo for the ſervice and honour of God, and for the good of Profeſſors and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="238"/> Gods Church, and of offendors, and for thy own good.
